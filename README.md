# YokosukaJS

YokosukaJS is a simple functional programming-style beat-em-up game engine.

It makes use of a state machine and pre-defined states and animations to model "actors" in a game world, who are given direction by "directors". These directions take the form of simple commands like "walk forward" or "punch". The system determines the next frame of animation to display based on the current state and the input direction.
